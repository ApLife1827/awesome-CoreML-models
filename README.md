# Awesome Core ML models
This repository has a collection of Open Source machine learning models which work with Apples **Core ML** standard.

If you want your model added simply create a pull request with your repository and model added. 
Apple also has published some of their own models. They can be downloaded [here](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/).

Those published models are: **SqueezeNet, Places205-GoogLeNet, ResNet50, Inception v3, VGG16**.
